# MP03: Length Conversion

### By Jimmy Lynch

For my Unit Conversion project I created a length conversion application that converst between cm, in, feet, yard, meter. I found it quite easy to utilize what we have learned, I feel myself getting used to Swift!

Reflections:
- should use "feet" instead of "foot"
- should change the output to be a condensed double, with less trailining decimal point values. I tried to figure it out, but couldn't find a solution quickly. Will need to reevaluate this issue later on.
- Could make it more visually appealing.
